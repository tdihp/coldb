# ColdB

ColdB is a column-oriented static database-like storage framework

## What is it?

ColdB consists a table schema, a data-generator, and a code-generator.
Aiming at small-amount of data, ColdB takes advantage of column-based
compression techniques to minimise storage size, and maintain performance
of random-access. Suited for mobile/embed system data storage with both
limited storage resource and CPU strength.

## How is it going?

Project just started, in heavy construction now :-D.
